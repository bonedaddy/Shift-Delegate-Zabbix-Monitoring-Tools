# Shift Delegate Zabbix Monitoring Tools

This repo contains some bash scripts, templates, and screens that I use to monitor my SHIFT delegate node.
This will be continually updated, and improved over time.

# Free Monitoring
If you would like your node to be monitored, but don't have the resources to setup a Zabbix instance, feel free to reach out to me on the shift ryver chat channel and I can setup my Zabbix system to monitor your node for free! My name on the chat is "Post Ables"

# Tips

If you wish to help support me, I would more than appreciate a vote for my delegate "shiftmobile" or by sending SHIFT to 5476868952712264143S
